## Summary
Inspired by my frequent use of Carousell, I felt like creating a clone app whilst learning React Native would be an
interesting way to pick up the basics of app design and have a better understanding of what code drives such apps
behind the scenes.

## Setup
In the project directory, you can run: 

```bash 

npm start
yarn start
expo start 

``` 

Runs the app in the development mode. 
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. 

The page will reload if you make edits. 
You will also see any lint errors in the console. 

```bash 

npm test
yarn test
expo test 

``` 

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. 
See the section about running tests for more information. 

```bash 
npm run build
yarn run build
expo run build 

``` 

Builds the app for production to the build folder. 
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
